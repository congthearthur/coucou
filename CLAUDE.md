# Heyllo — guide for AI coding agents

Heyllo is a native macOS app (`Heyllo/`); `windows/` is the Tauri version for Windows and Linux. Lexy, a small animated character living in the MacBook notch, shows AI coding agent sessions (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity and more) and a few integrations, and lets the user approve, answer, chat and drop files from the notch.

## Where things are
- `Heyllo/Sources/App/` — all Swift code. `Heyllo/Resources/sounds/` — the 28 WAV sounds. `Heyllo/project.yml` — XcodeGen project (never edit the `.xcodeproj` by hand).
- `Heyllo/Sources/App/PillCatalog.swift` — single source of truth for all declared pills (workspace tools, agents, AI providers, services). Every pill ID, color, category and subtitle lives here.
- `Heyllo/Sources/App/LexyGeometry.swift` — Lexy's shared dot-cluster face/eye/hand geometry, used by the main island pill, the launch greeting and the upload sequence.
- `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` — behaviour, views, states, integrations (in French).
- `windows/` — the Tauri app for Windows and Linux: Rust in `src-tauri/`, TypeScript in `src/`, the `coucou-hook` relay in `hook/`. `windows/README.md` lists what differs from the Mac.
- `docs/*.html` — the GitHub Pages site (privacy, terms, support, legal notice).

## Build
```
cd Heyllo && xcodegen && xcodebuild -scheme Heyllo -configuration Debug build
```
Windows and Linux: `cd windows && npm install && npm run tauri dev`

## Rules
- Swift 6, SwiftUI + AppKit. No third-party dependencies unless truly unavoidable. The character is drawn in code (`Canvas` + `TimelineView`), no Rive/Lottie/images.
- Secrets live in the Keychain, never on disk or in git.
- No telemetry. Network calls only to services the user configured.
- Never block Claude Code: if the app doesn't answer, the hook exits immediately.
- Never overwrite `~/.claude/settings.json`: dated backup, merge, show the diff, write only after the user confirms.
- Never send an email or approve a Claude Code permission without an explicit click.
- Performance: 0 % CPU when the island is hidden.
- Keep the bundle identifier `app.heyllo` (Keychain items, preferences and permissions depend on it).
- Never restyle what already ships (pills, cards, Settings, chat…): existing views stay exactly as they are in `main`, which is the App Store build. Change the look of an existing view only when explicitly asked.
- Pill IDs are stable contract values (Keychain, UserDefaults, hook routing): never rename an existing pill ID.
- New views follow the existing app style.
